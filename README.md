THIS IS A FRONT-END CHALLENGER GIVEN BY THE COMPANY NAMED (DEEP-THOUGHT); I FOUND THEM ON INTERSHALA AND, IT'S ALL TO FILTER 
THE ONE CANDIDATE FROM OTHERS (WELL, I SHOULD BE LIKE THIS; AND I LIKED IT); I HAVE WORKED HARD IN THIS PROJECT; AND IF ANYONE FROM THE DEEP-THOUGHT CREW/GROUP-
MEMEBERS READING THIS; I HOPE THIS PROJECT OF MINE INTERESTS YOU, AND I'M ALSO (EVEN MORE NOW) LOOKING FORWARD TO WORK WITH YOU ALL 
GUYS:

IT TOOK ME 3 DAYS DAYS TO DO ALL THIS: EVERYTHING IN THIS PROJECT USES VANILLA HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT (VANILLA == PURE);

LASTLY; IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE; AND SOME ASLEEP NIGHTS ALSO WENT ON DOING THIS; I HOPE YOU ALL GUYS LIKED IT;

THANK YOU;; I LOVED WORKING ON IT
